					<h2>What is Industry Conference?</h2>
					<p>Two day conf in Cleveland, Ohio for product managers, founders, designers, developers - anyone interested in making and selling tech products.</p>
					<p>One track: build, launch, scale</p>

					<h2>Overall Impression</h2>
					<h3>Good things:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Lots of friendly people</li>
						<li>Several useful talks for someone new</li>
						<li>Variety of topics was good, some very practical talks</li>
						<li>Didn't miss anything: one track</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Overall Impression</h2>
					<h3>Not so good things:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Didn't miss anything</li>
						<li>Inspirational, subjective "personal experience" talks</li>
						<li>Only one PM actually spoke - too focused on founders/founding</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#ee2a7b" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Day One: Build and Launch</h2>
					<h3>Key takeaway:</h3>
					<p>Take in more data and build products based on client needs/wants both known and unknown to them</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#92278f" data-transition="fade">
					<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/nireyal">Nir Eyal</a> - what makes some products so engaging?</h2>
					<p>"Habit forming products"</p>
					<p>You want to make products that form use habits in customers to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>increase customer lifetime value</li>
						<li>increase pricing flexibility</li>
						<li>increase defensibility (in tech, no rule that says the best product wins)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#1dadef" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>How do you form habits?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Sufficient frequency - use product every week, at least</li>
						<li>Attitude change - it's weird <em>not</em> to use the product</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Habits can be manufactured - but it's hard. We need to have a good idea of customer needs they can't articulate. Look to consumer psych for answers.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#09a8b8" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>The Hook</h2>
					<p>An experience designed to connect a users problem to a solution with enough frequency to cause habit.</p>
					<h3>Four parts:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> the call to action. External ("click here") and internal (memories and emotions eg. "I'm bored")</li>
						<li><strong>Action:</strong> the simplest behaviour done in anticipation of a reward (scrolling, liking, searching). For this you need motivation - make it easy to use, increase pleasure and avoid pain.</li>
						<li><strong>Reward:</strong> make users anticipate a reward through variability - there must be a connection between the variable reward and the internal trigger! (eg. social media when lonely)</li>
						<li><strong>Investment:</strong> more use = better product, and more successful triggers = more use</li>
					</ol>

					<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/Sabrinargordon">Sabrina Gordon</a> - Why Support Conversations Should Improve Your Product</h2>
					<p>Focusing too much on personas can make you miss <em>why</em> your users are trying to solve a problem.</p>
					<p>Temptations to deal with scaling support:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Triage:</strong> VIPs get great, tailored experiences</li>
						<li><strong>Busy out:</strong> ignore customers until they ignore you</li>
						<li><strong>Burn out:</strong> work current team to the bone. Leads to turnover, leads to organizational amnesia.</li>
						<li><strong>Outsource:</strong> including marginalizing the internal team, too.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#e0bf00" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Instead, have a support strategy</h2>
					<p>One that you follow no matter your size, where the support team is constantly in conversation with the product team.</p>
					<p>Support can give high quality, meaningful data to the product team so they can 1. Make decisions (Product Manager) and 2. Understand the importance of what they're building (team).</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#f36f21" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>UX and Support</h2>
					<p>From support teams you get unsolicited feedback, which is good because: it’s workflow driven, from an open conversation, and hits at blind spots you didn’t know you had</p>
					<p>UX and support data should both be used, the data complementing each other.</p>
					<p>Support team should be solving the customer’s problem while also solving the company’s problem.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#ee2a7b" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>How to Give Feedback to Product?</h2>
					<p>This can be tricky. Avoid <strong>frequency bias:</strong> thinking whatever's just come up is the most important thing - try not to react too quickly.</p>
					<p>Instead, look at data incoming over time: have a reporting tool where everything comes in, and tag them.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#92278f" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Intercom's internal tagging</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Unaware</li>
						<li>Confused</li>
						<li>Feature Request</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Unaware (of feature) and Confused (UI not clear, not sure about a feature) should be looked at frequently to see how you can improve your communication.</p>
					<p>Feature requests represent the customer voice - the PM can use these, balanced with product vision, to make product improvements.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/jandwiches" target="_blank">Maggie Jan</a> - Data-Driven Product</h2>
					<p>Build/Measure/Learn is hard to do when you don't measure or learn: enter analytics.</p>
					<p>Analytics allows you to adjust your product fit faster in response to real feedback.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#09b497">
					<h2>A Good Metric is:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Explanable</li>
						<li>Comparative (maintains context)</li>
						<li>Meaningful</li>
					</ul>
					<p>"A good metric is behaviour-changing"</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#88bb40">
					<h2>Applying Analytics to your business</h2>
					<p>Collect event data:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the action the person did</li>
						<li>state - who is the user</li>
						<li>time - when they did it, active users per day</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Visualize data:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>internal dashboard</li>
						<li>website</li>
						<li>heatmaps</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#e0bf00">
					<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Confirmation Bias</li>
						<li>Leading the Witness</li>
						<li>Correlation vs Causation</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To avoid these, involve more than one person in data-gathering, and be disciplined about how you capture your data.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/chriscbs" target="_blank">Chris Spiek</a> - jobs-to-be-done</h2>
					<h3>Discovering why people buy your product and why they fire it.</h3>
					<p>Has a mentor who always knew what to put in the product, while everyone else was feature-creeping based on customer feedback without a vision.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#ee2a7b">
					<h2>Jobs to be Done</h2>
					<p>A methodology inbetween the solution and the job (or the what and the why)</p>
					<p>Products are services - customers are trying to solve something in their life by using your product.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#09a8b8">
					<h2>How do we make product decisions today?</h2>
					<p>"More peanuts or less?"</p>
					<p>"Melting point of chocolate?"</p>
					<p>"Single or two pack?"</p>
					<p>This is a dumb way to think about things. No one buys a chocolate bar because they literally need two chocolate items in one package, or they need something with "some" peanuts but not too many.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#09b497">
					<h2>Milky Way vs. Snickers</h2>
					<p>The two aren't in competition: Snickers is thought of as "energizing" and solving hunger. Milky way is soft, endulgent - you eat it when you need comfort.</p>
					<p>Once you understand the job (solve hunger, gain energy, feel better emotionally) making the product becomes obvious.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#88bb40">
					<h2>Two JTBD tools to understand why people buy your product:</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>The Timeline</li>
						<li>The Forces of Progress</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>The Timeline</strong> is the process a customer goes through to get to buying and its result.</p>
					<p><strong>The Forces</strong> are what acts on a customer whenever thye're buying something.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#e0bf00">
					<img src="../images/timeline.jpeg" alt="the timeline">
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#09b497">
					<h2>The Timeline</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>First thought</strong> - I can do better</li>
						<li><strong>Passive looking</strong> - “I was driving to work one day and I saw a nice car, and then I started noticing new cars around everywhere”</li>
						<li><strong>Active looking</strong> - event one. Some trigger occurs that kicks them into action. They’re doing research into solutions.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Ask your clients what they were experiencing when they decided to go with your product, and do it soon after they made the choice.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#e0bf00">
					<h2>The Forces of Progress</h2>
					<p>The four forces acting on a consumer whenever they're buying a new product. Two promote choice, two block change:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Push</strong> - something's pushing their need for change</li>
						<li><strong>Pull</strong> - the push draws them in to make a decision</li>
						<li><strong>Anxiety</strong> - adding lots of features at once, for example</li>
						<li><strong>Habit of the present</strong> - think about what you’re switching from and how easy it is to stay where you are with your current situation</li>
					</ol>
					<p>When the top two are greater than the bottom two, people will make a decision to buy.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#09a8b8">
					<h2>How to find out how your customers choose a solution?</h2>
					<p>Do interviews with people who have purchased your product and people who've fired it.</p>
					<p>Ask them to tell you the STORY of how they made the decision to buy or not buy. Do not talk about the product itself.</p>
					<p>Find the <em>energy</em> in what they're saying - when they're energy spikes, go after that information.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="fade" data-background="#09b497">
					<h2>Day Two: Scale</h2>
					<h3>Key takeaway:</h3>
					<p>Moar data</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#88bb40" data-transition="fade">
					<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/rrwhite" target="_blank">Richard White</a> - Customer Feedback: The Other Half of the Data Story</h2>
					<p>Uservoice surveyed 300 Product Managers on how they do things.</p>
					<p>Product management today: how do we decide what the right product roadmap is? We get in a room and make it up.</p>
					<p>Who has the most influence over product roadmaps? PM's, C-levels, and then everyone else.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#e0bf00" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Data "revolution"</h2>
					<p>It's pretty slow. But gradually we're using customer data to make more decisions. Customers have a lower and lower tolerance for bad digital experiences, and executives know this. PMs get pressure from them to change.</p>
					<p>But how do we get the customer feedback to learn <em>why</em> what is happening is happening?</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#f36f21" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Direct from the customer</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>52% of PM's said they don't currently have a way of getting direct feedback from customers :|</li>
						<br>
						<li><strong>Lots use excel</strong> - this isn't scalable</li>
						<li><strong>surveys</strong> - but response rates are low</li>
						<li><strong>Text analytics</strong> - from all incomming qualitative data streams. Advanced, you get trending keywords, etc. Basically just stuff.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Result:</strong> "some customers are talking about billing a lot."</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#ee2a7b" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>What does work?</h2>
					<p>Online services - feedback out in the open (like uservoice - surprise!)</p>
					<p>Indirect, through sales and support - support is an excellent source of feedback, they have a huge interest in improving the product.</p>
					<p>But tagging/categorization, or just conversations randomly occuring aren't good enough.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#92278f" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>How can we do this better?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>link issues to the route cause - this is what we’re doing at salesforce. This is a billing issue, but what kind of billing issue is it? link the tag to the actual issue. eg. “billing issue > didn’t have mastercard” instead of just "billing issue”</li>
						<li>sales guy loses deal because we didn’t have a feature, every time that happens it goes in and we can see how many people request things</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#1dadef" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Then what?</h2>
					<p>Now that you have contextualized user feedback, what do you do with it?</p>
					<p>We can start integrating it with other data: revenue, spend, longevity of customer, happiness, etc.</p>
					<p><strong>Result:</strong> "500 customers have asked for this, they represent 15% of revenue they’re 10 of my top 100 accounts, etc. etc. etc."</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#09a8b8" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Product Management as Portfolio Management</h2>
					<p>With this feedback, you can start to make decisions like:</p>
					<p>"This quarter we’re going to do 60% slam dunk stuff, 10% totally innovative, 30% inbetween, etc."</p>
					<p>Because you know who the customers are, what the most important and numerous ones care about, and where the potential growth is.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#09b497" data-transition="fade">
					<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/aviranm" target="_blank">Aviran Mordo</a> - Advanced A/B Testing</h2>
					<p>Experiment Driven Development: Wix did over 700 experiments on their users just in August 2015</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#88bb40" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>What is A/B testing?</h2>
					<p>Having two versions of the same thing you want to test out, and see which one works better. A is the existing version, B is the new change.</p>
					<p>Collect this data, then compare the two options, once you reach statistical significance you stop the experiment and scrap what doesn’t work</p>
					<p>WixPETRI - manages their AB testing: <a href="http://github.com/wix/petri" target="_blank">github.com/wix/petri</a></p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#e0bf00" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>How to do it?</h2>
					<p>When you start an AB test, start with 10% of the users, measure how they react to this new feature</p>
					<p>Then slowly start to increase the percentage if numbers look good for the B</p>
					<p>This can take a long time to reach statistical significance.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#f36f21" data-transition="fade">
					<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
					<p>Product Management has a long way to come.</p>
					<p>Most are either founders/co-founders, or more senior people from other areas who moved over.</p>
					<p>PMs who focus on collecting, analyzing customer data and responding by building products with that data in mind are very valuable.</p>
